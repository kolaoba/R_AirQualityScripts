## A Lazy Approach to Tweet Scraping and Some Mild Stalking - Part 2

![twitter_word_cloud](../plots/twitterfoodwordcloud2.png)

Hello again! How' was your week'd your week go? Mine was busy too! Between Coursera, Data Engineering projects and work, I may need to subscribe for that 30-hour day plan you mentioned earlier. Hook me up with a link in the comments, tenk you.

Last week, we introduced generating word clouds from Twitter with R using the Twitter API. You can check out how this was done on [Medium](https://kolaobajuluwa.medium.com/twitter-word-clouds-with-r-f72a06c9b540) and/or [RPubs](https://rpubs.com/kolaoba) for the word cloud interactivity.

Also last week, I promised we'd build a Shiny App for some mild stalking. It'd interest you to know that as at the time I wrote last week's article, I knew only of the existence of Shiny Apps, nothing more. That being said, It's Saturday evening, grab a cup of ice tea and let's dive in!

## What's a Shiny App?

Glad you asked! A quick google search for the [official shiny homepage link](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) presents us with the following, "Shiny is an R package that makes it easy to build interactive web apps straight from R." 

It basically means I can code up all my "magic in R and present a non-coding end user with an easy-to-use interactive interface for viewing my analysis.

The official website offers many ways to learn how to build them, check them out [here](https://shiny.rstudio.com/)

## Let's Stalk Someone
So I took last week's exportwordCloud function, tweaked it a little, fed it into the app's architecture and I present you with the stalker app, as promised. 

With this app, you can look up any twitter user's handle to generate a word cloud of their last 1000 tweets.
Gives you an idea of what they've been talking about.

It's really easy to build and I'd leave the code on my github in case you want to reproduce
